    Pork chop is a dish that needs no introduction to anyone. Without a doubt, it is one of the classics of Polish cuisine. It charms with its juicy interior of tender meat and crispy, golden coating. It should not be missed at a Sunday dinner. We suggest how to make the best pork chops marinated in milk and fried in lard.

<ul>
    <li>lion 1.2kg</li>
    <li>milk 1l</li>
    <li>eggs 4pcs.</li>
    <li>wheat flour 60g</li>
    <li>breadcrumbs 100g</li>

</ul>

        <strong>Chops</strong>: divide the meat into 8 equal slices. We lay them out on a cutting board and cover them with cling film. Break them with a pestle into chops about 0.5 cm thick.

        <strong>Milk</strong>: pour into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. We put the chops in it. We cover them and put them in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The time for soaking the chops in milk is not included in the classification of the dish.

        <strong>Coating</strong>: prepare three separate plates with coating elements. First dust the chops with flour, then dip them in lightly beaten egg, and finally coat them in bread crumbs.

        <strong>Frying</strong>: in a large heavy-bottomed skillet, heat lard. Fry each pork chop over medium heat until browned. This will take about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the finished meat to a plate lined with a paper towel to get rid of excess fat.
